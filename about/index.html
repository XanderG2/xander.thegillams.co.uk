      <h1>Hi! I'm Xander.</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website. This place has been my main expressive outlet for my code and programming since 2017.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>
        I am an amateur programmer and I take an interest to computer science and programming as a whole. I learned how
        to code in 2017 using HTML on <i>this website</i>! I love to learn different aspects about different programming
        languages.
      </p>
      <h2>What else?</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy a lot of different types of music, and I love to talk about music. My favourite bands are My Chemical
        Romance, Rev3rent, Cannibal Corpse, Modern Baseball, Leathermouth, and Pencey Prep. I listen to genres including
        metal, emo, punk, hardcore, noise, grindcore, and gorenoise. <br />
        I love to debate and I enjoy discussing politics. I'm very opinionated on certain subjects, and I believe in a
        fairer and equal communist system. <br />
        I enjoy gaming, specifically survival, rhythm, platforming and factory-building games, such as Minecraft,
        Valheim, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program, Celeste, and Geometry Dash.
      </p>
      <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
      <p>
        This website exists as a passion project for me to be able to put something out there and have other people see
        it. I think it's pretty cool that someone that doesn't know me could be reading this right now. I also use this
        to practice web design: this is the 5th iteration of what I want this website to look like, and the first time
        I've written an about section longer than 1 line.
      </p>
      <h2>Anything else about programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Yeah, I love to learn new languages, and at the time of writing this, I'm in the process of learning F#.<br />
        I know Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS/HTML, and Lua. <br />I am learning F#. I have before programmed in C,
        C++, CoffeeScript, and Java, however I'm not very confident in those right now. <br />I will be learning C# and
        Haskell, as they are required for college.
